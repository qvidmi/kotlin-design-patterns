/**
 *
 * The Factory Method is a creational design pattern which uses factory methods to deal with the
 * problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
 * This is done by creating objects via calling a factory method either specified in an interface
 * and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by
 * derived classesâ€”rather than by calling a constructor.
 *
 * Factory produces the object of its liking.
 * The weapon {@link Weapon} manufactured by the
 * blacksmith depends on the kind of factory implementation it is referring to.
