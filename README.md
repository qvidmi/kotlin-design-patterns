# Introduction

Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.

# Getting started

Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various
Programming/Software Design Principles.

All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI,
and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and
patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical
extensibility.

Once you are familiar with these concepts you can start drilling down into
patterns by any of the following approaches

 - Using difficulty tags, `Difficulty-Beginner`, `Difficulty-Intermediate` & `Difficulty-Expert`.
 - Using pattern categories, `Creational`, `Behavioral` and others.
